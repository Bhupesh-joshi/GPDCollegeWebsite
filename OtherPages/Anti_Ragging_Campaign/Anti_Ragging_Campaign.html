                    GP Dwarahat has been able to maintain a “Ragging Free Campus” over the last couple of years. In our endeavors for ensuring the same we have received invaluable support from the students and their guardians. Today, ragging has become synonymous with teasing, terror, harassment, cruelty, fear , physical and mental torture and abuse of human rights of fresher which is resulting in numerous avoidable deaths, suicides, group clashes/conflicts and a large number of fresher dropouts. GPD considers ragging as a cognizable and heinous offence and does not hesitate to take stern action against the offenders with a view to maintain “Ragging Free Campus”.
